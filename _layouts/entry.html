            This post is from one of several previous incarnations of
            this site and probably doesn't quite fit the current format.
            In a former life this was a group blog and a tumblelog
            before it became a static jekyll site. If anything looks
            broken or is worded oddly that could be why. Pardon the dust.
            </p>
