===============

This is the source for my personal site at [matt.tarbit.org][mt],
which runs on [Jekyll][jk] and is hosted with [GitHub Pages][gp].

The `_scripts` directory contains a few little helpers. One to generate
posts from an old version of my blog's database that I had lying around,
and a couple of tiny convenience scripts for running jekyll and sass in
watch mode.
