Thanks to Apple's OS 10.1.5 now even IE features Quartz rendering. The 7.2 MB download is available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/DOWNLOAD/IE/ie52.asp), although the page is a bit vague on details of the improved features.

At the risk of being controversial, does anyone else think Quartz rendered text is actually harder to read and a bit too blurry? (I'll just go dig my asbestos suit out of the cupboard).
