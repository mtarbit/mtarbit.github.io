WIRE01, the all-night rave event featuring Takkyu Ishino, Westbam etc, happens this Saturday at Yokohama Arena. Yours truly won't be going because of a Japanese test on Sunday (good forward planning there), but Sega and Sony will be there in full force. The event is going to be the first chance the public gets to play the much anticipated [REZ](http://www.u-ga.com/rez/index.html). A [big poster](http://www.u-ga.com/rez/img/kanban010905.jpg) on the side of Shibuya station proclaims that the game will get released in November, and unlike the west, it will be Japan's first Sega PS2 game.
