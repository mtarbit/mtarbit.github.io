I got a [l'Espion](http://www.digitaldreamco.com/shop/espion_review.html) digital camera a while back after seeing Matt @ [Frownland](http://www.frownland.com) recomending them. This camera is the size of a box of matches and dangles from the end of a key ring, so obviously the image resolution is pretty crap. In an effort to extract a modicum of extra resolution out of mine I've taken to making mini Hockney style [joiners](http://www.getty.edu/artsednet/resources/Look/Landscape/hockney.html).
Here's some I took today in Northumberland, [Crag Lough](files/CragLough260302.jpg), [Tracy and Steel Rigg](files/SteelRigg26302.jpg), taken at [2&deg; 23' W 55&deg; 0' N](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=europemac&amp;X=377500&amp;Y=567500&amp;scale=50000&amp;width=700&amp;height=400&amp;gride=&amp;gridn=&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=ap&amp;overviewmap=ap&amp;scale=50000&amp;multimap.x=180&amp;multimap.y=192)
