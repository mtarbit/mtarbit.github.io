[Sonic the Hedgehog](http://www.afsh.co.uk/) celebrates his tenth birthday this year. On the [23rd June](http://www.famousbirthdays.net/june23.htm), [Sonic Adventure 2](http://www.sonicteam.com/sonicadv2/sonic_e.html) for the Dreamcast will be released worldwide to commemorate the fact. 
[Alan Turing](http://www.turing.org.uk/) was also born on this day in [1912](http://victorian.fortunecity.com/vermeer/287/diary1912.htm). Thanks for computer science, Alan!
