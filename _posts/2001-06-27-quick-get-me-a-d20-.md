There's a nice interview with Dungeons and Dragons creator [Gary Gygax](http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/032/127/010507-f2.html) in the archives at CDmag.com. He talks about how RPG's have evolved from the days of paper and dice, to the current state of the art [Never Winter Nights..](http://www.neverwinternights.com/)

And btw if you understand this post's title your secret's safe with me ;)
