[SEGA](http://www.sega.com), courtesy of their [Hitmaker](http://www.hitmaker.co.jp) division, are giving you the chance to build your very own [limited edition Dreamcast!](http://www.segagaga.com/sggg_model/index_copy.html) If that tickled your fancy, try [more of the same](http://www.hitmaker.co.jp/top/lounge/furoku/sggg_pm/home.html) (but slightly older) and then [redecorate your desktop](http://www.hitmaker.co.jp/top/lounge/furoku/home02.html).

Warning, some of these pages are Japanese... learn a bit of Japanese or try randomly clicking on links near words like "Windows" or "Macintosh". Sorry about that, but the contents are well worth the effort, I promise.
