Playstation 2's killer app, MGS2, has been [delayed](http://www.fgnonline.com/playstation2/news/19940.html) by Konami due to it featuring terrorist activity in New York and scenes featuring the World Trade Center. Konami say they are removing footage which feature the New York skyline and the twin towers of the WTC. [Rumour](http://www.tendogamers.com/cgi-bin/newspro/fullnews.cgi?newsid1000754482,29977,) has it though that the final battle of the game may have taken place inside the WTC, and featured a plane or helicopter crashing into the building. No firm details of how long the game will be delayed by are available yet..
