It's often said that scientists have little taste in aesthetics, so it should come as no surprise when a budding tech slave, [Yoshi DeHerrera](http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/aboutus/story/0,24330,3336336,00.html), comes up with something as ugly as this: [Yoshi's Boxx](http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/supergeek/story/0,24330,3381725,00.html). Basically it's a collection of nextgen consoles and a custom PC with random factor Atari 2600 and NES thrown in there to fill the empty space. The fact that he's put a custom PC and an Xbox in the same box strikes me as a waste of space - he could have fit a [Dreamcast](http://www.gamecritics.com/editorial/dreamcast_war_01.html), Saturn and Megadrive in there instead!
