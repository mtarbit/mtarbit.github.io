[Amusement Vision,](http://www.amusementvision.com/) [Sonic Team,](http://www.sonicteam.com/) [AM2,](http://www.sega-rd2.com/) and now [Hitmaker](http://www.hitmaker.co.jp/home.html) are all working on Gamecube titles. When you look at the amount of games these companys are responsible for and then remember that until recently they were all part of Sega. Its just seems incomprehensible that the Dreamcast had such a short lifespan, cheers Sony..

PS: Try having a look at the Japanese language pages on the above sites they seem to be much more uptodate then the English ones..
