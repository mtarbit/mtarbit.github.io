Designed for the education market Apple today released the [eMac](http://www.apple.com/education/emac/). Featuring a 17" monitor, and 700mhz G4 processor this could be a big hit in it's target market. It's a shame Apple can't bring a 17" iMac to the normal user on the street like all those rumors had suggested. [Insanely Great Mac](http://www.insanely-great.com/news.php?id=334) have an interesting take on the story.
