Seems like all the games journo's went to Spaceworld and forgot to come out again, there's not been much update from yesterday so far. The [Tendobox](http://www.tendobox.com) and [Nintendojo](http://www.nintendojo.com) sites both appear to have gone down under the strain of the legions of fanboys accessing them, either that or the server technicians have flown over to Japan and left the sites in the hands of the cleaner..

Generation N have posted a full transcript of the Shigeru Miyamoto [roundtable discussion](http://www.generation-n.net/news/news001771.shtml) from yesterday.

IGN have posted new movies of [WaveRace](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies2/waverace.mov) and [Pikmin](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies2/pikmin.mov), the Waverace movie being particularly impressive for the quality of its scenery and the speed at which the game apparently plays.

[SuperMonkeyBall](http://cube.ign.com/news/37759.html) officially the best thing ever?

[GenerationN](http://www.generation-n.net/spaceworld01/movies/index.shtml) now have a good round up of all the movies posted so far..
