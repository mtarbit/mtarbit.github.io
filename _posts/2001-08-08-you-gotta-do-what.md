[Magic Box](http://come.to/magicbox) have new screenshots and information about [Parappa the Rappa 2](http://mb.vgdirectory.com/game080601g.htm).
As well as battling against the conspiracy of the Noodle Army, it looks like we'll finally be able to meet Sunny Funny's father, (a character originally intended to be in the first game) who is, of course, a flowerpot.
