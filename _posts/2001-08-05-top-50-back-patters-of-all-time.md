title: Top 50 Back Patters of All Time
---

Gamespy.com's feature on the ["Top 50 Games of All Time"](http://www.gamespy.com/articles/july01/top50index/), errm, strikes me as just a little  PC centric and biased.. Only one console game in the Top 10 surrounded by 9 RTS or FPS titles?!?! 2 Ultima games in there!?!? is Starcraft really better than Zelda?!?! Says a lot about the American develpoment community.. And how do they have Richard Garriot heaping praise on his own games?
