If the current trend for reality TV is all about getting a smug sense of self worth from watching the dregs of humanity whore themselves for the sake of their 15 minutes worth, then MTV's [Jackass](http://www.mtv.com/mtv/tubescan/jackass/) has to be the ultimate antidote. 

[Johnny Knoxville,](http://www.angelfire.com/celeb/johnnyknoxville/RollingStone2101.html) Spike Jonze and Jeff Tremaine have a lot to answer for. Along with co-colaborators [Bam Margera,](http://www.bamargera.com/) [Chris Pontius,](http://www.stuff-o-rama.com/yeti.html) [Dave England,](http://www.snowboardermag.com/hot_air/extra_ball/) Steve-O, [Brandon Dicamillo,](http://brandondicamillo.tripod.com/Jackass/id6.html) Ehren McGhehey, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna and [Ryan Dunn,](http://ryandunn.tv/) they have created a show which has the US moral majority on the warpath.
