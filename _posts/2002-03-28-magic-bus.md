Warp are taking to the road with their [Magic Bus tour](http://www.warprecords.com/tour/). The line up includes Keith Tenniswood, Mark Bell, Plaid and Prefuse 73 among others, although Warp's website doesn't make clear which artists are playing which venues. The tour hits Traveller in Newcastle on the 1st of June.
