Or in beta at least. Now that this is the case I'd like to ask you for your opinions on what works, what doesn't, what could be better etc. I know that a lot of this stuff isn't easy to use at the moment but this is it's first functioning incarnation so you can't expect miracles just yet. 
Please keep your comments as encouraging as possible, and bear in mind that we still have a lot of bits and pieces left to implement so suggestions should be of the minor tweaks variety rather than major revisions.
