The Star Wars episode one DVD. Who cares about the film, the six hours worth of bonus material stuff should make this worth the asking price alone.

Audio commentary from five different points of view, seven deleted scenes completed just for the DVD release, five behind-the-scenes featurettes, one hour-long documentary, galleries and storyboards and a partridge in a pear tree.

Check out the [full rundown](http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/2001/06/news20010619.html) over at the official Star Wars site.
