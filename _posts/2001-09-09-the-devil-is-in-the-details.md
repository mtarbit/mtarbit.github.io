Not content with making sweet music, the Aphex Twin seems to have turned his hand to the visual arts.. visible only through spectrum analysis, a [cheeky little D. James original](http://chaos.yerbox.org/face/) is apparently hiding inside the sound of Track 2 from the Windowlicker single (girl version). Is this just face-in-the-moon type wishful thinking? Or does this [strangely symmetrical image](http://chaos.yerbox.org/kesson/) produced by analysis of a track from DrukQs point to further audio/visual experimentation?

Update: Ok, not convinced yet? I have no idea if this is genuine or faked.. but [here's some clearer evidence](http://www.tp.spt.fi/~cleth/aphex.gif)  for your appraisal.
