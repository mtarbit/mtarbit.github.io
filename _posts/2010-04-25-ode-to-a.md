In the pub on friday the subject of geek pilgrimages cropped up. Trips to MIT, One Infinite Loop, the Googleplex, that sort of thing. I've yet to partake myself, but I can definitely see the appeal.

In a similar vein, I mentioned [Code Rush][cr], only to be met by blank looks all round.

A documentary from the close of the nineties, about crunch time at Netscape in the run-up to the release of Mozilla. If you haven't seen it and those words evoke anything for you, then you should. [Jamie Zawinski][jwz], [Brendan Eich][be], history, pathos, what more do you need?
