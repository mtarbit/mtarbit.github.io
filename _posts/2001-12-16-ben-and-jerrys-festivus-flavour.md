An Ice Cream for the rest of us. I didn't know this existed, (sorry if its old news to you), my favorite Ice Cream makers do [a special edition](http://www.benjerry.com/festivus/) in honour of one of my favorite sitcom [episodes](http://www.interlog.com/~porteous/festivus.html)! Frank Costanza would most definately not approve.
