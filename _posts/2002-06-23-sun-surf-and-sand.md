After the relatively disastrous trip to Dunstanburgh [last month](http://www.pixelised.com/comments.php?id=340), we returned at the weekend but this time walking in from [Low Newton](http://www.accta.co.uk/VILLAGES/NEWT.HTM) to the North. As you can see the weather was beautiful, rolling clouds and lots of sunshine, but it was still blowing a force 10 gale. Apart from Northumberland and Western Scotland I'm not really that aquainted with the British coast but I imagine you'd have to go along way to beat the stretch between Alnmouth and Berwick.
