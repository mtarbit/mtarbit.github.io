This ridiculous [reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=sciencenews&amp;StoryID=734520) being linked to by the [usual suspects](http://www.slashdot.org) made me laugh. Apparently the use of handheld electronics is causing a mutation in youngsters hands making the thumb their most dextrous digit! I quote:

<blockquote>"In her research, Plant noticed that while those less used to mobile phones used one or several fingers to access the keypad, younger people used both thumbs ambidextrously, barely looking at the keys as they made rapid entries."
</blockquote>
Hmm, so to reiterate: people who are used to doing something are better at doing it than those who aren't? Well no shit sherlock.
