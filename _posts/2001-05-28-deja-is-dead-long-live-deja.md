[Google](http://www.google.com) has quietly reinstated the archives it [aquired](http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease48.html) from the Deja news service behind it's beta front end. I've never really payed that much attention to [usenet](http://tuxedo.org/jargon/html/entry/Usenet.html) before but, with archived postings dating back to 1995,  there's a mind-boggling array of textual information in there on just about [any subject imaginable](http://groups.google.com).
