Last week, [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/) let loose a rumour that Nintendo were going to announce something big at E3... something big that wasn't going to be just another (amazing) game title. Soon after, some guys on the [GameFAQs Gamecube Message Board](http://cgi.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.asp?board=965) sussed out that this was related to display peripherals.

So then everyone started puzzling over 3D display technology, including the lame attempt that Sega made in the arcades, way back when, with [Time Traveler](http://www.klov.com/T/Time_Traveler.html). Well, it seems like the guys at MediaFuzion might have cottoned onto something much more concrete. It seems Nintendo have made a bit of a slip-up and dropped subtle hints in their own screenshots. [This one](http://mediafuzion.com/nuke/article.php?sid=113), in particular, shows us some "doubling" at work, which could well be used in conjunction with some 3D specs to bring us "ultra-realistic" three-dimensional graphics, the like of which have not been seen since [Muppet Vision 3D](http://www.wdwig.com/m_muppets.htm)!
