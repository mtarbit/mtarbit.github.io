I read [this great book of essays][hg] recently. Successful games designers of all stripes writing about the games closest to their hearts. It's a fun read, though some of the essays struggle a bit in evoking the appeal of games you've never seen before. Especially since the book contains no illustrations.

To help with that, I've put together a kind of "[Hobby Games - A Visual Companion][vc]". For the most part, I tried to find the cover art for the game edition specified in each essay, but there may be one or two that are incorrect.

The board & card game imagery was relatively easy to source through the [BoardGameGeek][bgg] API, with a bit of manual tweaking. But I was stuck for RPG data until BGG added [rpg.geekdo.com][rpg] to their portfolio just the other week and I was finally able to fill in the gaps. A very welcome addition, I'd say, and well worth a look, though it can be a touch sluggish at times.

And finally, if you have the book and find the thumbnail page at all useful, you might also be interested in [Alan De Smet's various dissections][ads] of the book's data.

I should also mention that there's a companion volume, [Family Games: The 100 Best][fg], due out later this month.
