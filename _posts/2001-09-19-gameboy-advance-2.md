I'm not sure what to make of this one, [Cloudchaser](http://nintendo.cloudchaser.com/news/index.php?view=54) are reporting that there may be a new version of Gameboy Advance in the works. The new unit is said to feature a higher contrast, backlit, screen. Part of me hopes this is true and part of me doesn't..

UPDATE: [PlanetGamecube](http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=2100) has more details, it looks like it could be true..
