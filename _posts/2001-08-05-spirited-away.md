[Hayao MIyazaki](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/) has just broken Japanese [box office records](http://asia.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/asia/08/02/japan.spirited/index.html) again with his new release ["Spirited Away"](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/sen/). His last masterpiece [Princess Mononoke](http://www.play247.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R1&amp;title=88756) held the record for highest grossing Japanese film of all time before James Cameron's Titanic came along. Hopefully a western release won't be too long in coming..
