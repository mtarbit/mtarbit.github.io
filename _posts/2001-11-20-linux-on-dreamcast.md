With the arrival of Gamecube, XBox etc. you may have been thinking of putting your humble DC back on the shelf (unless you're getting [Shenmue II](http://www.shenmue.com/shenmue2/) of course). Fear not though as Takeshi Yaegashi is hard at work on [Linux for Dreamcast](http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/dreamcast/). Shame I don't have the broadband adapter for my DC or I could hook it up to my network hub and play with it from within OsX on my Mac.
