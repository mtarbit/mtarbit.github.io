Well that was my favourite part from the original anyway... the speech did it even more justice too. Yes.... [Tekken](http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/tekken_plot_a.txt) is heading to the [Gameboy Advance](http://www.eagb.net/advance/), just in case you've had you're head in an PS2 hard drive bay for the past week.

Anyway, looks like fun. It's in pseudo 3D... it doesn't look like the GBA can quite handle proper 3D yet. There's some mode 7 action going on for the infinite scenery (infinite in the horizontal plane, that is) and there's some nicely rendered sprites in the foreground. And what's more, according to the information that's been available so far, all the characters are from the original!!! Hooray!

Here's hoping Spaceworld has a playable version!
