I've said [recently](http://www.pixelised.com/comments.php?id=292) that I've been extremely impressed with Mozilla 0.9.9 on OSX, and that it's now my default browser. Well, [Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/) has just been unveiled and we're one step closer to the full release of Mozilla 1.0. I'm just off to [download](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/) it, if anyone else has done so already post some comments on how it looks..
