[Richard Linklater](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Linklater,+Richard)'s animated film '[Waking Life](http://www.wakinglifemovie.com)' sees it's UK cinema release this weekend. I think Matt may have mentioned it in the past, but I just saw a short documentary on it Sky News is running and have been completely blown away.
The film is of special interest to Mac users as it was made on a host of G4s. Footage was shot by a small crew as normal live action on DV camcorders. The footage was then converted in Quicktime, before being passed through rotoscoping/[animation](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,47433,00.html) software on the Macs to give it a comic book look.
Waking Life is a series of vignettes exploring the boundries between reality and dream worlds, communication and human desires. It opens in cinemas across the UK this Friday, and receives its [R1 DVD](http://www.play.com/Play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R1&amp;title=101786) release on the 7th May.
