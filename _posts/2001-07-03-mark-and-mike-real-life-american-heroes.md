1999's [American Movie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767846869/qid%3D994180550/104-7252821-5067131) blew [Mark Borchardt](http://www.americanmovie.com/) to superstardom, but fame is a fickle mistress and he soon disappeared from the public gaze. This hero of the trailer park hasn't been resting on his laurels though, and has been busy fighting his own guerrilla war, turning his back on Hollywood and a quick buck in favour of artistic integrity. Along with sidekick [Mike Schank](http://www.americanmovie.com/bios/ms.html) he puts out a regular [cable TV show,](http://www.0tv.com/) appears at [film festivals,](http://www.filmthreat.com/Interviews.asp?File=InterviewsOne.inc&amp;Id=138) and has recently acted in Jet Li movie "The One". Keep up the good fight Mark..
