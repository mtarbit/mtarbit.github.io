O'Reilly's forthcoming book Essential Blogging is [up for public review](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1440)! You can download [9 of the 10 chapters](ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/outgoing/essential_blogging_tr.zip) as PDFs. The book mainly covers the ins and outs of the major players in blogging software. So it might be a bit less relevant to those of us who roll-our-own, but with bloggers like Rael Dornfest and Cory Doctorow contributing there's bound to be one or two chapters worth a read.
Which clumsily segues into the fact that [Wiley Wiggins](http://www.wileywiggins.com/blog.html) is currently guest blogging over at [bOingbOing](http://www.boingboing.net/).
