[Christophe Thibault](http://mamedc.kaillera.com/) has released version 0.1 of MAME for DC. For those of you in the dark the [Multi Arcade Machine Emulator](http://www.mame.net/) allows you to play the arcade games of your youth on the computer system of your choice. This Dreamcast version only supports a few games at the moment, but keep checking back for updates..

Christophe's page links to James Surine's [Mamed](http://digita.mame.net/) site, James is also working on a DC version of MAME. Check out MAME and Doom running on a Kodak Digital Camera while you're there too..
