In a shock pre-E3 [announcement](http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=3010) Nintendo have revealed their plans to take Gamecube online by this Fall. Nintendo says that both a v.90 and a broadband modem will be released for Gamecube, both at a low pricepoint of $34.95. The first online enabled game looks set to be Phantasy Star Online: Episode I & II from Sega.
