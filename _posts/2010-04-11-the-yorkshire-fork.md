So my lovable lady vife has started an emblogulation over at [theyorkshirefork.co.uk][tyf]. It's food-focussed, since that's the great love of her life (sniffle), but it's also entertaining enough that it'll hold your interest even if, like me, you're not a foodie by nature.

She's been posting up a storm on a roughly daily basis so there's plenty to see already. And I know I'm biased and all, but I reckon you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't read a post or two and see how you like it.
