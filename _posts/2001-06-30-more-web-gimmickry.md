Do you ever get so bored that your Googling degenerates into [complete nonsense](http://www.google.com/search?q=winnebago+elephant+tapestry) just to see what'll come out the other end? Well be careful you're not being watched! [Disturbing Search Requests](http://searchrequests.weblogs.com/) documents the twisted query strings of pervy madmen, dug up from the depths of some poor innocent's log files.

And don't think for a moment that your offline conversations are safe either! [InPassing.org](http://www.inpassing.org/) records the overheard ramblings of strangers. (I'm slightly sceptical about the number of interesting overheard things per day though, since it's supposedly just one woman's eavesdropping that fuels the site)
