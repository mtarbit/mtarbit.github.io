Alias / Wavefront are runing a [quiz](http://www.fakeorfoto.com) on their site to see if you can spot the difference between photographic and CG images. Its actually a bit more like can you spot the cheese smothered stock photo, but  it's interesting non the less..
Damn, only 7 out of 10, and I work in photography and digital imaging :(
