title: While away the hours

By staring at this perplexingly puzzle-icious flash game over at [input-entertainment.de](http://input-entertainment.de/laser/). Use a variety of differently shaped mirrors and lenses to direct a laserbeam around a maze lighting up bulbs as it goes. Several of the levels took me a good half hour to figure out, but I'm up to level 18 so far. Beat that if you can!
