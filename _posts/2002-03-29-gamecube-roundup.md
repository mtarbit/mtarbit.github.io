Its been quite a week for announcments from Nintendo. First they announced the release dates for the first [Super Mario](http://www.pixelised.com/comments.php?id=285) game in 5 years. This was followed by news that PS2 exclusive [Timesplitters 2](http://www.planetgamecube.com/previews.cfm?action=profile&amp;id=169), created by the former Goldeneye team at Free Radical Design, was also due for simultaneous release on Gamecube. [Mario Party 4 and 1080 II](http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=2839) recieved their Japanese release dates, but possibly the most important announcment of the week was that Monkey Ball creator and EDGE contributor Toshihiro Nagoshi's [Amusement Vision](http://www.amusementvision.com/) division at Sega would be developing, one of the jewels in Nintendo's crown, [F-Zero](http://cube.ign.com/articles/356/356325p1.html) for Gamecube and arcades.
