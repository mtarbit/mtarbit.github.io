If like me you own a Jap/US Gamecube you'll have been suffering from the dearth of A Grade titles from Nintendo since Christmas. Well the flood gates are about to open over the next couples of months with more potential classics on the way than you can shake a stick at.
First out of the traps is [Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem](http://cube.ign.com/articles/363/363071p1.html), Nintendo's first atempt at taking on the "mature" gaming market. The couple of reviews i've read so far have both used the words "one of the best games we have played..ever", so fingers crossed for when it turns up from [DVD Box Office](http://www.dvdboxoffice.com/).
