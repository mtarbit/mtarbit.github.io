"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." F. Bueller (1986)..

Sorry about the lack of posts around here for the last week. We've both been upgrading our Macs to OSX.1 and have been occupied with "finger trouble".. Matt's modem has been knocked out altogether and my system has decided to block me from this, my own site, if I connect through my usual ISP..

Anyway normal service will be resumed soon, so please bear with us :)
