Xbox get's a Japanese release date, 2002.02.22 - coincidentally, the date [JSRF](http://www.jsrf.com/) gets released Stateside. It remains to be seen how well the Japanese public will lap-up the new hardware. No doubt the current trend of pre-order package lunacy will not get off the ground this side of the pacific. [Kabuki Warriors](http://xboxmedia.ign.com/media/previews/image/kabuki/bg03.jpg) looks like it's primarily being crafted for the eastern audience, but the graphics look like they have some way to go to compete with the likes of [FFX](http://www.ruliweb.com/data/news2/07m/ps/ff10/cg04.jpg), [ICO](http://ps2media.ign.com/media/e32001/image/sony/ico_6.jpg) and [MGS2](http://www.konami.co.jp/kcej/products/mgs2/topic/topic_e01.html).
