This article has to be read it's [so funny](http://www.adequacy.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/12/2/42056/2147). Read the original piece and then move onto the posts below, witness as war breaks out between those who understand the meaning of the word "satire" and those who don't. I found myself laughing out loud as people start taking the piss out of the h4x0rs and concerned parents who, even then, couldn't see the error of their ways.
