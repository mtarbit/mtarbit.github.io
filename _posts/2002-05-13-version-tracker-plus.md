VersionTracker.com has today launched a new subscription service called [Version Tracker Plus](http://www.versiontracker.com/mp/propageapp.m?page=plus). For an annual fee of $19.95 the subscriber gets access to a range of features includeing  personalised watch lists and the abillity to toggle Ads on and off. One of the listed features i find a little odd however is the 'view previous days software', you can already do this through the standard website so lets hope they arent going to start reducing the functionality of the normal service in a bid to win your subscription.
