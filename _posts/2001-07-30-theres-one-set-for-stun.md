So you had the Ree-Yees, Yak Face and Snaggletooth. You had the Rancor Handler, Sy Snootles and Max Reebo and you even had a [Chewbacca Bandolier](http://www.toysrgus.com/images-toys/figuretoys/bandolier.html) to stick them all in. But I'll bet you didn't have a [Gargan prostitute](http://www.toysrgus.com/images-art/gargan-wax.html) or a [Mongo Beefhead Tribesman](http://www.toysrgus.com/images-speci/85LineExt/85LineExt07Mongo.html). 

Read about them and other [never-released](http://www.toysrgus.com/images-unproduced.html) toys in the treasure-trove that is [toysrgus.com](http://www.toysrgus.com/collectors.html). Then spare a moment to remember the other [forgotten heroes](http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/513.html) of Star Wars.
