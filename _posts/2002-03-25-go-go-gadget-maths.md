I saw Darren Aronofsky's [Pi](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0138704) for the first time last night. I'd been meaning to see it ever since getting [Requiem For A Dream](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0180093) on DVD but never managed to get round to buying it. For those who haven't seen it it's the Kafkaesque story of a mathematics genius and his all consuming search for the meaning of life through mathematical theory. During the course of the film the main character, Maximillian Cohen, visits his old college professor to play Go and talk maths. I was thinking while watching that I'd always wanted to know how to play Go, anyway to cut a long story short guess what popped up on memepool, [Go](http://www.usgo.org/index.asp), [Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicRulesOfGo), [Go](http://www.goproblems.com/), and if you're feeling social, [Go](http://games.yahoo.com/games/login?game=Go).
The film comes highly recommended too btw.
