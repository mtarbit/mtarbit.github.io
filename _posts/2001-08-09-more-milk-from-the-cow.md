The fun continues over at the [Cult of the Dead Cow](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/main.php3)'s house, with more on Peekabooty, in the form of Oxblood Ruffin's [open letter](http://nationalpost.com/tech/story.html?f=/stories/20010726/628083.html) to the President of the People's Republic of China, and TechTV's streaming video coverage of [cDc at Defcon](http://www.techtv.com/cybercrime/story/0,23158,3337379,00.html).
