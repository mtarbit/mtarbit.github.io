7 days to [Gamecube](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ngc/index.html). Only three launch titles, Luigi's Mansion, Wave Race and Super Monkey Ball, but at least you don't have to spend $500 on a pre-order. In fact, even pre-orders are proving difficult to guarantee for launch now. Stocks of Luigi's Mansion were all booked up over a week ago. First impressions to come next Friday.
