Hot on the heals of Mozilla 1.0 comes an Alpha version of [Mozilla 1.1](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.1a/), now including Quartz rendering under Mac OS 10.1.5. Other improvements include DHTML performance enhancements, faster start-up, improved download manager and better drag and drop support. The 17mb download is available [here](ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.1a/).

On a similar subject I just installed the [Orbit 3+1](http://morbit.cdn.gs/) theme for Mozilla. You'll either love it or hate it, Its possibly a little too colourful and fussy for me but it sure does make a change from the drab themes that ship with the standard installation.
