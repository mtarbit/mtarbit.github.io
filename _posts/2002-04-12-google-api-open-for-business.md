Further to yesterday's post, it seems that [Google's Web Service](http://www.google.com/apis/index.html) is now officially open. Or at least ready for testing and tinkering. Oreillynet is punctual as ever with Rael Dornfest's [comprehensive tutorial](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1283) on how to get started. There's a [devkit](http://www.google.com/apis/download.html) available for download from Google with sample SOAP requests/responses and Java and .NET bits and pieces to set you off on the right path. You'll also need to sign up for an [account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?continue=http://api.google.com/createkey&amp;followup=http://api.google.com/createkey) since they're sensibly limiting developers to 1000 requests per day, and 10 results per response while still in beta.

Speaking of [mr. Dornfest](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/35), I'd heard his name bandied around before, but hadn't quite linked all his achievments together.  He's the man behind the small and perfectly formed [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blosxom/) weblog app. He's also behind Oreilly's [Meerkat](http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/) RSS newsfeed portal. And last but not least there's his excellent [Raelity Bites](http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/) blog (See the "Googling for Rael" sidebar for an early-adopter application of the API).

Oh and by the way, the post before this was number 300. Hooray for us! Have a browse through [our archives](/archive.php) for a taste of our not-so-long and prestigious history of cutting edge reportage.
