This years entries are up at [the5k.org](http://www.the5k.org/list.asp?y=2002&amp;how=list-by-rating-desc). Unfortunately it looks like the efforts to shave off those last few bytes have meant an end to any cross-platformification. The current leader of the pack is an awesome windows IE only version of [Wolfenstein 3D](http://www.the5k.org/description.asp/entry_id=946). This tiny, jerky little bitmap miracle has to be seen to be believed.

I'm not even sure how it's done, it appears to be redrawing a single graphic on the fly and the code looks like javascript. Some of the comments mention xpm and xbm, but googling for those doesn't turn up much other than that they're graphics formats.
Can anyone satisfy my curiosity? 

Update: I've put a slightly de-obfuscated version of the code [here](/files/wolfenstein5k/wolfenstein.html) for anyone who wants a look, and click comments below for a little bit more detail on how it seems to be done.
