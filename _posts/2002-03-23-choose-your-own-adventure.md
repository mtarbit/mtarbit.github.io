I used to love adventure gamebooks so it's a real treat to find this collectors [lovingly maintained site](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/list.htm) which lists just about every one I ever had. The ones I remember best are the [Choose Your Own Adventure](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/cyoalist.htm) books, TSRs [Endless Quest](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/eq1list.htm) series, Steve Jackson & Ian Livingstone's [Fighting Fantasy](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/fitefant.htm) books (of course), and my personal favourites [Be An Interplanatary Spy](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/spylist.htm), of which I owned all but the last 2.

The Fighting Fantasy list has relatively few for some reason but the unofficial [fightingfantasy.com](http://www.fightingfantasy.com/index2.htm) has ridiculous amounts of information. No cover scans though for some reason.

Gamebooks are sort of a spiritual counterpart to [interactive fiction](/comments.php?id=111) so it's cool to see there was even a [Zork](http://www.netaxs.com/~katz/game/zork.htm) series! 

What strikes me as odd though is that they're all such obvious contenders for being given a new lease of life online, yet one of the few things I can find that comes close is  [Jerk Your Own Adventure](http://www.jerking.com/).
