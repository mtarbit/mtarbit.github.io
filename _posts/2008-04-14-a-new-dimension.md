I haven't read too deeply into this, but I've seen a couple of signs lately that the movie industry might be looking to make money out of 3D (as in 3D glasses, and not specifically CGI). Disney's re-releasing the \[Toy Story films in 3D\]\[ts\], \[Pixar\]\[px\] is planning on releasing all it's films in 3D starting next year, and \[James Cameron\]\[jc\] has been doing some serious research into it for his closely-guarded upcoming blockbuster "Avatar". I wonder if this is something they're banking on to differentiate the big-screen experience from the DVD market. A return to the days when a trip to the cinema was a big event.

Not that home entertainment necessarily has to miss out, there's also the question of whether the videogame industry might be quick to make a similar move. Apparently BoomBlox (the upcoming EA / Steven Speilberg collaboration for the Wii) is to feature a \[head-tracking 3D mode as an easter egg\]\[ee\]. See \[Johnny Lee's presentation at TED\]\[jl\] for a recent demo of this technique.
