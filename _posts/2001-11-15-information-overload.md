Television's future aired on BBC1 in the UK tonight. The follow up to the BBC's groundbreaking CG fest Walking With Dinosaurs, Walking With Beasts had its first showing. What made this already fantasticly high production value show all the more remarkable was that it was the first BBC documentary to be fully interactive for [Digital Satellite](http://www.sky.co.uk) owners. Interactive viewers were treated to two different narration tracks to choose from. Constantly updating pop-up facts were accesible through your remote. As were two entirely seperate video tracks one showing a picture in picture "Making Of" the series, while the other showed more documentary evidence to back up the main points the show was making. I've watched the show 3 times now with a totally different experience each time..
[Walking With Beasts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/beasts/) is backed up by a suitably interactive Web Site at BBC.co.uk.
