I know it's not the type of thing we normally have on here, but this pair of identical twins with an arty prediliction for hardcore surgery have to be seen to be believed. Ryan and Dave could easily be a photoshop hoax, but I have a nasty feeling they're all too real. If ever there was a warning against body-modification [this is it](http://www.bme.freeq.com/people/addsub/index.html). (nb: there is one gore photo but the rest are end-results )
