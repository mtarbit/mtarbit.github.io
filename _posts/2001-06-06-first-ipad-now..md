[This?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/19486.html) But hang on a minute, removable tablet-style screen? Sounds suspicously like [this 1994 prototype](http://www.theapplecollection.com/design/macproto/015.html) for a modular mac that Apple unceremoniously dumped when the [media](http://www.doonesbury.ucomics.com/strip/retro/timeline/90s/930827.htm) poo-pooed their handwriting recognition software. Methinks it would be met with much the same reaction now.
And what is it with all this dubious next-mac speculation anyway?
