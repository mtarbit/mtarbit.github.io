Yet another mediocre excuse for a [game-based film](http://raven.clanplaid.net/akichart.jpg) is on it's way in the form of Resident Evil: Ground Zero, directed by [Paul "Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon" Anderson](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Anderson,+Paul+(III)). But think of what could have been! R.E. was once to be scripted by king of undead-horror himself [George A. Romero](http://www.georgearomero.com/) and you can even read [the script](http://www.new-blood.com/features/romeromovie/REScript.txt) that they callously threw away.

So will there ever be a good game-movie? Of course not! Games that appeal to hollywood are invariably based on movies in the first place so by the time the idea has come full circle any last interesting elements are bound to have been sapped out of it. Resident Evil is Day of the Dead, Tomb Raider is Indiana Jones and Super Mario Bros. .. well there's no real excuse for that one.
