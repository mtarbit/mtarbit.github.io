Just thought I'd bring to your collective attentions a couple of web oddities I've stumbled across recently, the first being [filepile.org](http://www.filepile.org)  a public file sharing site brought to you by [Andre Torrez](http://www.torrez.org) among others. Secondly, there's [qwer.org](http://www.qwer.org/) a (semi-)public scrapbook site (there's a bit more [explanation here](http://www.fury.com/article/795.php)) brought to you by Kevin Fox of [fury.com](http://www.fury.com). Fury is a new addition to my list of "sites I regularly visit", if you're checking it out be sure to stop off at Kevin's other projects [AOLiza](http://www.fury.com/aoliza/) and [RandomPixel](http://www.randompixel.com) while you're at it. 

Both FilePile and Qwer are fairly useless after a cursory exploration, but it's nice to see that new uses for old tricks are still being thought up by clever folk with too much time on their hands. Even if not every one of them's a [hotornot](http://www.hotornot.com).
