[Darren Aronofsky's](http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/int/2000/10/13/aronofsky/) adaptation of Hubert Selby Jnr's Requiem for a Dream has just had its [Region2 DVD](http://www.play247.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R2&amp;title=94910) release. Aronofsky's study of addiction tells the story of 4 people and their relentless pursuit of happiness at all costs. The film starts as a summer love story between [Jared Leto](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Leto,+Jared) and [Jennifer Connelly](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Connelly,+Jennifer) (the 2 best looking actors in Hollywood?), by the time winter comes and the film draws to its inevitable conclusion however your hands will be over your eyes, unable to watch, as they plunge head first down the spiral of addiction and self abuse. Aronofsky has created a film of extrordinary beauty and tragic morality, directing with a flair and talent that few in Hollywood can match.. Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that will change the way you see things for ever, it comes [highly recommended](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie-1100652/)..

Aronofsky's next project, an as yet untitled Sci-Fi movie is set to star Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt. He is also working with Frank Miller on Batman:Year One for Warner Brothers..
