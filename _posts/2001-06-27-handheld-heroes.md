Reedy has pointed me in the direction of the awesome [Handhelden,](http://www.handhelden.com) a site dedicated to handheld gaming nostalgia. 
Handhelden is brought to us by the creators of the fantastic [Electronic Plastic](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3931126447/electronicplasti/202-2588523-5985432) book, and features an absolute treasure trove of retro gaming action..

The site also features a nice links page if you fancy takeing your trip down memory lane further..
