O'Reillynet has an [interesting piece](http://oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/04/09/future.html) by [Tim O'Reilly](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/27) about  what the thirteen-thirtyseven geeks are saying are the technologies to watch in the days to come.

The roll-call is low on revelations, but towards the end Tim goes into a discussion of  the relationship between custom web-spidering and web-services. The gist of it being that we're going to see a lot more of the big database sites (amazon, imdb) providing low-to-no cost web-services similar to that which Google seems to be planning on offering with the [recent announcement](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/06/1354223&amp;mode=thread) of it's [beta RPC interface and API](http://api-ab.google.com/search/beta2).

Tim also covers many of the same topics from a slightly different perspective in [this interview](http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/04/08/020408opcurve.xml?Template=/storypages/ctozone_story.html) with infoworld.
