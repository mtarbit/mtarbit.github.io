title: And out of the chrysalis emerged
---

After our extended hiatus we're back like a pantomime cow, with a refined back-end and a cheery new front-end. The two main changes you can actually see are the new playlist sidebar, and the absence of the registration and login system. You should now be able to post comments with a minimum of hassle. Just give a name and away you go. There's also a new "about us" page with a little about who we are and how to get in touch.

As always, if you spot anything untoward or have an idea for a feature you'd like to see on the site, drop us a mail at [info@pixelised.com](mailto:info@pixelised.com). Oh, and let us know what you think of the changes too.
