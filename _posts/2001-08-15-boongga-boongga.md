When I first saw [this promo poster](http://www.monzy.com/intro/boong-ga/brochure.jpg) for a buttock-fixated coin-op named BoongGa BoongGa I presumed it was a hoax, but then who can ignore the [irrefutable evidence](http://www.sixsixfive.com/229.html) of a man dressed as poo-poo. 

Now all we need to know is wether or not a certain japanese correspondant has had the good fortune to see one of these babies in the wild.
