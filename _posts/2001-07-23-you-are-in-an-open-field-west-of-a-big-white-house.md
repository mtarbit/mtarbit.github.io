In today's games a lot of our imagining is done for us, so there's still something very intriguing about the long-retired genre of text-adventuring. The king of the interactive fiction hill was undoubtedly [Infocom](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/), with [Zork](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/zork1.html) as their crowning glory. Adventure Collective has interviews with original staffers [Dave Lebling](http://www.adventurecollective.com/articles/interview-davelebling.htm) and [Steve Meretzky](http://www.adventurecollective.com/articles/interview-stevemeretzky.htm). You can play many of the [classics online](http://www.saturn.powerup.com.au/ddesoto/infocom.htm) through the wonder of java, or if you prefer the MUD feel, [try telnet](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/) (if it's not too busy that is).
