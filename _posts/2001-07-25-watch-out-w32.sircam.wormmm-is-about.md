Some of you in the windows world may have had the pleasure of getting aquainted with a particularly virulent strain of worm by the name of [SirCam](http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sircam.worm@mm.html) over the past week. For those of you who are unaware of this massively [malicious mobile code](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/malmobcode/), here's a quick breakdown of it's [finer aspects](http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32sircama.html):

- Has access to addresses in both your address book and your browsers temp folder.
- Contains its own SMTP mail engine, allowing it to mail itself without relying on Outlook.
- Emails random files from your hard drive to all and sundry.

That's right, any file on your hard-drive to any address on your computer..
And they're only getting better, successful virii such as this invariably leave a lot to be desired. Poorly written message bodies are a regular failing, but then what else can you expect from non-english speaking script-kiddies. So when someone *really* wants to do the job properly, I think we'd best take cover.

But hey, let's not get down about it.. [this virus does good things too](http://slashdot.org/askslashdot/01/07/25/1510213.shtml)!
