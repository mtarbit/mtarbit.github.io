Whilst checking to see if [Hayao Miyazaki's](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/miyazaki/) Sen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi ([Spirited Away](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/sen/)) had been released on DVD yet, i stumbled across the almost unbelievably awesome [Studio Ghibli DVD Player](http://www.anime.org.uk/aorguk.nsf/News/983BE06B2BF934DE80256B9200679EC8?OpenDocument) which is destined to come bundled with some versions of the DVD.
