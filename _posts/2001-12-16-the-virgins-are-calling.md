Oxblood Ruffin "Foreign Minister" of [cDc](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/main.php3) has written a piece for [the Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk) entitled, ["Microsoft, terrorism, and computer security"](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/23418.html). In it he argues that Microsoft's "security through obscurity" policy is grossly irresponsible in the light of September 11th and that, in the world we find ourselves living today, Microsoft can no longer afford to put it's marketing goals ahead of real concerns about the security of it's products.
