[SEGA](http://dreamcast.ign.com/news/35923.html) are diversifying out of the videogames market. Plans include a new arcade business based on fitness clubs, could this be an advanced version of Jonnyram's "Games can be healthy" post? They are also planning on developing their characters further. This is an area which Nintendo excells at, and harks back to Disney's classic business model. 
They also seem to be planning on moving into the animated film and theme park markets.
In fact it sounds to me like they're trying to steal the Disney business model lock, stock and barrel..
