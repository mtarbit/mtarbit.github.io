So what's it all about? Well, this is my new website. Mostly a blog, but in its dreams it's part tumblelog (give me a little while longer to work on that).

There's quite a bit here already that I've been pack-ratting around for so long that I thought it was about time I built it a home. If you peer into the [archive](http://matt.tarbit.org/archive/) you'll see that there's a few years worth of links culled from my bookmarking on del.icio.us, and a whole half decade earlier there's a few hundred blog entries from a more innocent age. Those were rescued from the ashes of a site called Pixelised that my brother Dan and I used to run.

Err, I'd link to that on [the wayback machine](http://www.archive.org) but it looks like their developers might be having a bit of an off day. I did feel like web archival was in relatively safe hands until just now.

Anyway, it's been odd spending a good 5 years out of the blogging loop, and this website's really the outcome of too many times when I've felt like jotting something down and had nowhere to jot it. It's also odd being a web developer for a day job and having nowhere handy outside of work to try out more hobbyist or experimental ideas. Hopefully this little hypertextual homestead (ha) will go some way to meeting both those needs.

Next post: less of the meta-blogging and navel-gazing hopefully. Au revoir!
