[TendoBox](http://www.tendobox.com) has a translation of a Famitsu [interview](http://www.tendobox.com/columns/index.cgi?id=130) with Yuji Naka and Toshiro Nagoshi of Sega. They love Gamecube, although things aren't looking too good on the PSO front, 4 player split screen and no apparent online support mean it may need to be renamed Phantasy Star Offline :(
