In the run-up to the release of [Peekabooty](http://www.pixelised.com/px_forum.php?aid=10), the [Cult of the Dead Cow](http://www.cultdeadcow.com) have released two statements in order to [clarify their position](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html) and announce the inaugration of their [Hacktivismo](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/HacktivismoFAQ.html) offshoot. Scary to think that the future use of the internet is being defined by ill-informed governments behind closed doors, and for the most part without the publics knowledge. And reassuring to know that groups like cDc aren't going to stand for it.
