If [Quiter](http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~nanko/) is to be believed then tomorrow Japanese Gamecube magazine [Dengeki](http://www.dengekionline.com/) will reveal the existence of previously unannounced [Mario and Zelda games](http://cube.ign.com/articles/357/357694p1.html) from Nintendo. If true it will mean that Gamecube will be seeing 2 Mario and 2 Zelda games within the next year.
