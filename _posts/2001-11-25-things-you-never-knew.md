Tim Hunkin's [Rudiments of Wisdom](http://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com/) contains a wealth of practical knowledge on every subject under the sun, served in the form of cartoon "how-to" guides. For those who like to get their hands dirty, there's [Hunkin's Experiments](http://www.hunkinsexperiments.com/) as well. \[via [haddock.org](http://haddock.org)\]
