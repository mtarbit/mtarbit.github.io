Good to hear that the lead writer on Fallout 3 is also the writer of the Dark Brotherhood storyline from Oblivion, which was, I think, everyone's favourite. Things are definitely looking up after the false start at E3. Looking forward to getting the original Fallout from GOG.com when it launches tomorrow.
