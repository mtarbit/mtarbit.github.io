I mean, what's [this](http://www.apple.com/powermac/) supposed to be?! It looks like they haven't finished the front off. And where's my flat-panel iMac?

It seems they've painted themselves into a bit of a corner with their fancy stylings these days, in that whenever they release a new machine I just check to see if it looks any good and barely glance at the specs. Surely there's only so many shapes and configurations that can be practical. Besides, it seems a touch odd to be releasing hardware that mainly appeals to one audience on looks while releasing software that mainly appeals to an entirely different market on internals.

Though, I suppose that's the whole idea.

While I'm on the subject of Apple, OS X v10.1 (how clumsy is *that*?) is due in September, and by the looks of the [preview page](http://www.apple.com/macosx/newversion/) they've finally fixed a lot of stuff they should have had down in the first place. For instance; a movable dock, a genie replacement, some finder tweaks and all the DVD you can eat.
