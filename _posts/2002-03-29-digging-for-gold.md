One of my brothers in arms has come up with a little ditty about friends in our industry...
["Why do programmers pick their noses?"](http://www.mamachari.com/music/why_do_programmers_pick_their_noses.mp3) is the resulting anthem. Give it a listen and why not drop by his [portal](http://www.mamachari.com/) and big him up while you're at it.
