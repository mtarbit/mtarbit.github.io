Apple today [acquired Emagic](http://www.emagic.de/english/news/index.html#069) creators of the popular [Logic](http://www.emagic.de/english/products/logic/las.html) audio apps. "Macintosh-based products account for over 65 percent of Emagic's current revenues. Emagic's Windows-based product offerings will be discontinued on September 30, 2002". Ouch!
