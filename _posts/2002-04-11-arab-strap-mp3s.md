One of the best nights of my life involved seeing Arab Strap live, cheap Whisky, a flying kebab, a half ton block of sandstone,  my bleeding head and my girlfriends tears in the moonlight. 
If you've never had the pleasure then get over to Arab Strap's 'official' [website](http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/en/ht/idx.html), the [MP3 page](http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/en/ht/m.html) has a couple of CDs worth of MP3s to download, half of which are previously unreleased or rare demos and sessions etc. The files are all high quality rips and the music is all up to Arab Strap's usual exceptional standards.

Note: I just noticed the album tracks are only 30 second samples, but all the rare stuff is still good to go :)
