Looks like Apple will [launch](http://www.macslash.com/articles/01/09/24/1717238.shtml) the long awaited [OsX .1](http://www.apple.com/macosx/newversion/) update tomorrow during Phil Schiller's keynote address to the [Seybold Conference](http://www.key3media.com/seyboldseminars/sf2001/) in San Fransisco. It is expected that X.1 will be in stores by the weekend.
