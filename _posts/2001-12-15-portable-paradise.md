This week has brought us a couple of moveable retro-gaming feasts to whet your appetite.

After the success of the [PSp](http://www.classicgaming.com/vcsp/PSp/PSp1.htm) and [VCSp](http://www.classicgaming.com/vcsp/), the DIY portable console guy now brings us [SNESp](http://www.classicgaming.com/vcsp/SNESp1.htm). A portable SNES masterpiece complete with comedy photo-story walkthrough.

To top that we have not one but two GBA spectrum emulators! The [Foon](http://foon.pocketheaven.com/) site doesn't give much away, but the screenshots on the [Zxadvance](http://zxadvance.gbaemu.com/) one look amazing. Just grab a few .Z80s off [World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/archive.html) and give them a whirl.
