Veteran 1337 h4X0r5 the [Cult Of the Dead Cow](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/) were recently [in the news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1313000/1313399.stm) with their plans to release a [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org/)/[Gnutella](http://gnutella.wego.com/) style P2P browser called [Peekabooty](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/05/05/1459212&amp;mode=thread) to get around filtering and censorship of online content (The UAE blocked access to the cult's site for all citizens on hearing the news). With my interest piqued I had a little trawl round the cDc site, and while the text files on [Debbie Gibson fighting ninjas](http://www.textfiles.com/groups/CDC/cDc-0222.txt) and Poppy Z. Brite's [necrophiliac fantasies](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0341.txt) about William Burroughs certainly caught my eye, it was this explanation of [the cults name](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0365.txt) that made me smile the most.
