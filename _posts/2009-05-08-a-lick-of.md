If you're reading this in its native environment, rather than by way of an RSS reader, then you might notice things looking slightly different.

I did some work on the site a month or so ago and just got around to putting it live. Nothing spectacular, just a small layout re-jig, turning the volume down on the header bar and making room for a new library section on the front page.

I'd been using, and liking, \[LibraryThing\]\[lt\] but hit the 200 books pay-wall and didn't really feel like forking over the cash for it. I've also since signed up for \[Readernaut\]\[rn\], which has seen some hype, but doesn't really work for me, and am aware of sites like \[Good Reads\]\[gr\] and \[All Consuming\]\[ac\], but find them a bit lacking.

I want two things from a library/consumption site: to list my stuff (not just books, and not necessarily physical products), and to find more stuff. The current offerings either seem to get lost in the social aspects (Readernaut & All Consuming) or bogged down in too much data (LibraryThing).

Anyway, the site now has a library (sticking to \[books\]\[b\] for now). It's far from finished, and may never be, but better to put up what was there than have it languishing on my laptop for any longer.
