When meme's attack. The collaborative web artwork idea seems to be taking over, and yet I still haven't seen any particularly successful results. [Waferbaby](http://www.waferbaby.com) puts a different slant on it by going for [comics](http://www.waferbaby.com/fusion/) where each contributor only gets to see the previous panel. Of course every one trying to be a little whacky and surreal means the end results are streams of total non-sequiturs.
