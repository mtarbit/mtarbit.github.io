[Bjork](http://www.bjork.com) is back with her finest work yet. Her new Album "Vespertine" is due for release on August 28th. The Japanese version is already out though and can be picked up on [import.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005LLA2/o/qid=994964894/sr=2-3/202-5118244-0921446) Vespertine sees a shift of direction for Bjork, gone are her previous pop trimmings and in their place comes a darker, harder electronic edge that was hinted at on "Homogenic" . [Matmos](http://brainwashed.com/matmos/) have done a fine job, adding minimal techno rhythms under Bjorks tragically beautiful melodies. The influence of [Dancer in the Dark](http://www.play247.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R2&amp;title=91196) can be felt too throughout this album as Bjork delves into a far more mature, painfull, but paradoxically warm and intimate sound. Your average pop fan will see this a step backwards, but this album pushes Bjork over a creative barrier. She has always tried to maintain a pop outlook while her own musical tastes lie more to the avante garde. Vespertine sees her cast off these pop allusions as she ploughs straight towards her own musical influences and contemporaries.
I can't recommend this album highly enough. Bjork has come of age and it is a privilege to be here to see it..
