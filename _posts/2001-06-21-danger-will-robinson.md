Just to re-iterate our words of warning from yesterday's GBA contrast [post](px_forum.php?aid=46): Nintendo have now issued an [official warning](http://pocket.ign.com/news/35982.html). Apparently it's not a contrast control, it's a flicker control and messing with it could permanently damage your Gameboy in the long run.
