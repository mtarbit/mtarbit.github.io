Yep its true, the Gameboy Advance has a secret contrast control hidden under the sticker on its rear. [EAGB](http://www.eagb.net/cgi-bin/news/news.pl?action=gen_read_page&amp;id=uWNUoYz6dF) have the full instructions on how to adjust it. 
!!! WARNING: Pixelised does not condone making this adjustment and doing so may well invalidate your warranty so dont come crying back to us when you break your shiny new GBA...!!!

Update: It's been [confirmed](px_forum.php?aid=50), fiddling with this *will* permanently damage your GBA. We repeat, *do not* try this at home.
