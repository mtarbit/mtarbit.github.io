Unbelievable, I don't know if any of you have been following the story of [MacSlash](http://www.macslash.org/articles/02/05/31/1738247.shtml) losing their domain name, but it seems it's all been down to an iTools email account. Supposedly anyone with a [mac.com](http://itools.mac.com) account has their email pre-filtered, without their knowledge, for spam. Someone in their greater wisdom at Apple has decided to add domain name registration company [Dotster](http://www.dotster.com) to the list of blocked spammers, and thus MacSlash never got their renewal notices and have had their .com domain hijacked by a Spanish guy called [Vicente Peiro Crespo](http://www.dotster.com/Help/Whois/Default.asp?DomainName=macslash&amp;TLD=.com). I haven't read the fine print on Apple's iTools conditions but it seems pretty amazing to me that they not you choose what and what isn't spam on your own mail account.
