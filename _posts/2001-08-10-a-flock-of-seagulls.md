Japan's [GameWatch](http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20010810/doa3_2.htm) has some new screens of Dead or Alive 3 for XBox which display some of the consoles raw poly' pushing power. The screens feature a fight on a tropical beach between 2 female fighters, the sky is filled with maybe 50+ seagulls! If they're 3D models and not some form of sprite or texture then I must say I'm pretty impressed..

While you're there have a look at the limited edition [Hello Kitty GameboyAdvance](http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20010810/kitty01.htm), anyone's better halves got a birthday coming up?
