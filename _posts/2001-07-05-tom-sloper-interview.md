[Missingmatter](http://missingmatter.net/) has a Q&A with battle-scarred veteran of games design [Tom Sloper](http://www.sloperama.com/). It's not a name I've come across before, but a quick look round his site should give you some idea of the extent of his resume. And as a pure designer with no background in programming he has an interesting, non-technical take on the industry.
