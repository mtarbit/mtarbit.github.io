From a [faq session](http://www.aphex-twin.com/faq.html) on the official [aphex-twin site](http://www.aphex-twin.com/):
<blockquote>Q. Have you worked with anyone else on this album?
A. Yeah,at the beginning of 1997 I adopted 3 goats on my farm in scotland and taught them how to write music,I upgraded one of the goats at the end of 98' with a hoof mod and its fucking serious man/woman.</blockquote>
