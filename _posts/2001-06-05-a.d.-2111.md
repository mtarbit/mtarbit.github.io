Thought the Zerowing intro was (set us up) the bomb? You should see [the outro](http://zanyvg.overclocked.org/zerowing/zerowing-ending.gif) (featuring the california raisins by the looks of things). [Zany video game quotes](http://zanyvg.overclocked.org/) over at [Overclocked](http://www.overclocked.org) has all your mistranslation needs covered. Resident Evil is easily in the runnings for [the worst](http://zanyvg.overclocked.org/residentevil/relockpick.wav), but Barry's "What is it?!" is oddly missing.
