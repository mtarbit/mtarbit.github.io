After my [previous](http://www.pixelised.com/comments.php?id=286) mini joiners I thought I'd have a go at something a bit bigger. Switching to lo-res mode on the l'espion gives 80 shots, which although pretty useless for anything else are just about right for doing a big joiner. Anyway see what you think, [room joiner](files/RoomJoiner.jpg), and no comments about the decor :)
