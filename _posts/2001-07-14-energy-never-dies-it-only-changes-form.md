The demise of Company Flow left a sizeable hole in hip-hop, but that hole is now well on it's way to being filled with the birth of El-Producto's [DefJux](http://www.defjux.net) label. Figurehead signing Cannibal Ox have just released their debut album, [Cold Vein](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005BIVW/qid=995135392/sr=2-1/ref=aps_sr_pm_1_1/104-2962254-8635142). Rappers Vordul and Vast Aire carry on the vocal stylings carved out by the Co.Flow MCs, while El-P's production brings the [Funcrusher](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IADL/qid=995136234/sr=1-4/ref=sc_m_4/104-2962254-8635142) flavour.

Also watch out for releases from label-mates, Mr.Lif and RJD2, and the [DefJux sampler](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005AA1X/ref=sim_music/104-2962254-8635142) featuring the last tracks recorded by the one-album-wonder that was Company Flow. (Just be thankful it was a double..)
