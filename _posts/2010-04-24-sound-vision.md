So you're an internerd who spends far too much time thinking about games, right?

In that case, I'm sure you have some favourite websites that regurgitate press releases and opine at great length and so on, but don't your eyes get tired reading all those cramped-up little letters? Seems to me that the audio-visual side of things is sometimes under-explored. There's some great episodic stuff out there that you might be missing out on.

For example, are you following any of the following?:

#### Audio

* \[Idle Thumbs\]\[it\] - Industry types meet to talk games. Infectious giggling, stream of consciousness riffing, and passionate discourse ensues.
* \[A Life Well Wasted\]\[alww\] - Polished mix of documentary, interviews & soundscapes in the manner of _This American Life_.

#### Video

* \[Hey Ash, Whatcha Playing?\]\[hawp\] - Sibling duo. Fast-paced. Dick jokes. Lovable.
* \[The Independint Charles Show\]\[tics\] / \[Downtimetown\]\[dtt\] - _Consolevania_ creator Robert Florence infrequently reviews XBLIG releases and board game purchases.
* \[I Hit It With My Axe\]\[hwma\] - Footage from the regular sessions of the _D&D With Porn Stars_ guy's role-playing group.

There's a few more that I tried but couldn't stick with. \[Zero Punctuation\]\[zp\] was OK at first, but the style got old pretty quickly. There's the \[various\]\[padlc\] \[offerings\]\[padnd\] from the Penny Arcade media empire, but their latest \[PATV\]\[patv\] stuff seems a little bit self-aggrandizing in places. And there's Tom Vasel's \[Dice Tower\]\[tdt\]. That guy's just too prolific to keep up with, although I liked the \[Top 100\]\[tdt100\] run-downs with his daughters.

So that's my contributions. Know of any others I should be paying attention to?
