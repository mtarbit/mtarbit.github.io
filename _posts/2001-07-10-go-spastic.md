There's a new Squarepusher cd on the shelves ([Go Plastic](http://www.warprecords.com/ography/release.php?cat=WARP85)). And according to the (annoyingly difficult to link to) [warprecords](http://www.warprecords.com/artists/index.php?artist=afx) site: "the new Aphex Twin 30 track double album 'drukqs' was mastered last week in London." 
Life is sweet...
