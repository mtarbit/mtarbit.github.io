What is it about bands I like splitting up this year?

Well, first off there was [Judy &amp; Mary](http://www.wizstation.com/JAM/), the J-pop wonders, who have not only ceased to exist, they're official website has been yanked off the web too.

Swiftly after that J-rockers [Oblivion Dust](http://www.obliviondust.com/) and [Cocco](http://www.cocco.co.jp/) announced they were packing it in (did I scare all the musicians off or something?).

But now, with their eternally delayed (possibly canned) second album, it seems [Way Out West](http://www.wayoutwest.uk.com/) are no more. The second (fantastic) album had been available through Napster (RIP) for what seemed like Aeons. You might be able to get the majority of it from [AudioGalaxy](http://www.audiogalaxy.com/list/searches.php?searchType=0&amp;searchStr=way+out+west). The question remains, what happens to an unpublished album when the band splits up??? Am I destined to listen to it on my home-made bootleg CD forever?
