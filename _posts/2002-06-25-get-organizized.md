- A recent [kuro5hin](http://kuro5hin.org) article on [backlinks & annotations](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/5/16/152614/482) inspired by the recent blog trend for referrer links.
- A long article from the early days of Wired about pioneering information architect [Ted Nelson](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive//3.06/xanadu.html?person=ted_nelson&amp;topic_set=wiredpeople) and his Xanadu project.
- Beta chapters from the upcoming second edition of O'Reillys book [Information Architecture for the World Wide Web](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/infotecture2/chapter/index.html).
