How queer!

Was just browsing through this site's \[archives\]\[arch\] and found this link to a prescient \[Kuro5hin\]\[kuro\] article from May 2001:

> \[The Apple iPad\]\[ipad\]
> 
> * Tablet: 11.5" x 9" x 0.7"
> * 12" 1024x768 LCD touch- and stylus-sensitive screen
> * No keyboard or mouse (optional attachment via USB)
> * USB port
> * Dual speakers and headphone jack
> * Internal HD
> * 5-hour battery life and charging cradle
> * Airport wireless connectivity
> * 2-3 lbs
> * $999

Which is particularly peculiar because the iPod wasn't even released until \[5 months later\]\[date\].
