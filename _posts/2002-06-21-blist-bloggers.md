You know that weblogs have left the domain of geeks and teenagers when [Ru Paul](http://www.rupaul.com/weblog.shtml) gets one. He writes about "cunty she-mails" from "ignorant bitches"! He let's us know he's going to "back that ass up for a high colonic"! I'd swear it was a parody site if it wasn't so nicely put together. \[via [haddock.org](http://www.haddock.org)\]
