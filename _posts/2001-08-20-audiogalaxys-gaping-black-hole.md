After our recent recommendation of [Audiogalaxy](http://www.audiogalaxy.com)'s p2p filesharing software it's interesting to see [this article](http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/07/24/ag_security.html) on [Oreillynet](http://www.oreillynet.com) detailing their fantastically idiotic security policy (or lack of). According to the article, logging in to Audiogalaxy points your browser at a url containing your username and password, clearly labelled and encryption free.

The extent of the problem has even been [beautifully illustrated](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/584) by [Google](http://www.google.com)'s indexing of a couple of these [plaintext badboys](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=+site:www.audiogalaxy.com+audiogalaxy+loginusername).
