[Tron](http://www.tron-movie.com/) was an under performer at the box office on its release. Like many cult classics though with hindsight it can be appreciated in a different light. Pre-dating Gibson's Neuromancer by 2 years, Tron tells the tale of hackers battling inside a computer system to free it from the control of a meglomaniacal corporation with an AI behind them.. Sound familiar?
Writer and Director Steven Lisberger, along with artisitc help from the likes of [Moebius](http://www.stardom.fr/) and [Syd Mead,](http://www.sydmead.com/) produced a Sci-Fi classic. VFXpro have a good article entitled [Tron Revisited](http://www.vfxpro.com/article/mainv/0,7220,21407|1,00.html) which takes an indepth look behind the scenes of its making.
Steven Lisberger is currently reported to be working on [Tron 2.0](http://www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/realtron2.html) for Disney, lets hope it lives up to the standards set by its forebear..
