title: Final Fantasy XI Goes Multiplatform
---

SquareSoft's [Hironobu Sakaguchi](http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2781619,00.html) reveals to Gamespot that Final Fantasy XI the next edition of their long running RPG series will be multiplatform due to its online nature. Gamespot seem to think that the game will be making an appearance on Gamecube, but this seems very unlikely due to the bad blood between Nintendo and Square. If it does though, could this mean a re-emergence of one of the greatest partnerships in gaming history..
