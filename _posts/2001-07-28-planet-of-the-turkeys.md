So it's happened, [Tim Burton](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Burton,+Tim) has [failed](http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?File=ReviewsOne.inc&amp;Id=2058) [dismally](http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/301786p1.html) to re-create Planet of the Apes. With rumours of re-shoots being still done in the couple of weeks before release and preview screenings being pushed back it was inevitable really. [Planet of the Apes](http://www.play247.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R1&amp;title=94296) and its sequels were children of the 60's & 70's, political films which dealt with race and social opression. At the time they were powerfull stuff hidden behind the facade of a Sci-Fi action movie. In Hollywoods current moraly bankrupt climate though the politics have been ditched and the surface sheen is everything. Its a real shame that Hollywood's film making community no longer have enough courage in their political convictions to produce great movies which still have something to say about the real world we live in..
