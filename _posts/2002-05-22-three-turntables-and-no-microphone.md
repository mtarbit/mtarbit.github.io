I hate to sound like an 18 year old corporate whore, but [Jeff Mills](http://www.niitty.org/virus/jeff_biography.html) really is playing an absolute fucking blinder on [John Peel's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/peel.shtml) show at the moment, ( so much so that John Peel effectively just let him play for the whole show ). [Live at the Liquid Room Tokyo](http://www.homebass.ca/release/r4080.cfm) has to be one of the greatest mix albums of all time and one of  my favorite CDs.
