Microsoft began their campaign for gaming domination today with the [launch](http://www.xbox.com/news/0111/midnightmadness.htm) of [XBox](http://www.xbox.com) in New York. Only time will tell if they will be able to survive in the cut throat world of video games. Going off the [launch titles](http://xbox.ign.com/news/39879.html) it looks like they are going to have some trouble, [Halo](http://xbox.ign.com/reviews/15922.html) and [DOA3](http://xbox.ign.com/reviews/16249.html) looking like the only grade A titles. I suppose they'll pick up a good number of casual/first time gamers with their biggest is best advertising strategy, (I think the fact that they roped in "The Rock" at their launch event says a lot about their target market). Personally my money's down on a Nintendo [Gamecube](http://www.nintendogamecube.com/) which is released in the US this weekend.
