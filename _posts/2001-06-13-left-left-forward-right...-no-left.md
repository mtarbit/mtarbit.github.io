Sorry to lower the tone a little, but someone mentioned [Knightmare](http://www.angliatv.co.uk/angliagold/knightmare/content.html) in the Alien Front thread. So by popular demand [here it is](http://www.knightmare.clara.net/) dungeoneers! But beware, for danger may lurk everywhere...

Update1: Hehee! Apparently the slightly unsettling [decaying head](http://www.knightmare.clara.net/introduction.htm) that represented energy in the first few series had been sanitised into a cake with pieces being removed by series 8. Talk about losing your edge :)

Update2: This fan site even hosts an interactive [online version](http://www.knightmare.clara.net/rpg/) of the show every once in a while. Season three is due to start in september.
