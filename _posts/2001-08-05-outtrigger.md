[AM2](http://www.sega-rd2.com/outtrigger/) are back with another classic for Dreamcast. [OutTrigger](http://dreamcast.ign.com/reviews/12966.html) takes the FPS genre into the arcade with compact arenas, frenetic skirmishing, and innovative game mechanics. The Japanese aren't known for their FPShooters but SEGA's finest have proved they have a lot to offer when it comes to pushing the genre in a slightly different direction. OutTrigger limits the player to 3 basic weapons with the odd super weapon placed around respawn points on the arena floor. Far from limiting your options however this pairing down of hardware forces the player to concentrate on the micro rather than macro, and tactics and playing style become all important. With [OutTrigger](http://www.gamesstreet.infront.co.uk/Show.jhtml?prod_id=11423501) SEGA have once again proved that sometimes less most definately equals more.. 
Warning: Due to the fast nature of the game, OutTrigger plays a damn sight better with the mouse than with a joypad, and as such I'd recommend giving it a go first if you dont have a DC mouse..
