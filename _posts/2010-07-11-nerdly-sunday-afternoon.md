Discoveries from a morning's browsing: A tour of \[Origins Game Fair 2010\]\[origins\] in five parts. \[First part\]\[o1\] below, other parts here: \[2\]\[o2\], \[3\]\[o3\], \[4\]\[o4\], \[5\]\[o5\].

I used to wonder what this and \[Gen Con\]\[gc\] would be like to visit when I'd see photos in Dragon magazine as a kid. Much as you'd expect, there are some impressive displays mixed in with a bunch of tat. Still seems like it brings in a fair few exhibitors these days, but it's looking a bit light on attendees.

Related to that was this "\[one cool thing I saw at Origins\]\[saw\]" video, with multiple people mentioning \[Legerdemain\]\[ld\]. Which is a Java-based, rogue-like game, only lighter on the randomness and heavier on the story. Still has permanent death, ascii art and all that stuff you might expect, although I understand a graphical tile-set is in the works.

Incidentally, the principal developer Nathan Jerpe also wrote this piece on the limitations of the \[room as a metaphor\]\[room\] in interactive fiction, which I found kind of interesting a while back.
