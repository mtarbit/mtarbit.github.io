How's this for a new [Blogdex](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu) feature? The [Social Network Explorer](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/socnet/index.asp?ego=pixelised.com)! Does a good job of catching who's linked to who, mutual-linkage and the like. And the recommended list seems cool though I'm not sure how it's generated. You'd think it would be based on who'd linked to the same content, but who knows?

I hope this get's on Blogdex, that would be self-referential-icious. :)
