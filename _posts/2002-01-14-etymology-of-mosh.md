Grand Royal magazine puts forth the argument that the word ["Mosh" has it's origins in hardcore](http://www.grandroyal.com/mag/2000/nov/mosh/pop.php), more specifically HR of the Bad Brains and his admonitions to "Mash it up!".. who'da thunk?
If only the print version of Grand Royal had kept going longer. 6 or 7 issues was nowhere near enough. To ease the loss there's more bits and pieces from the online verson [here](http://www.grandroyal.com/mag/).
