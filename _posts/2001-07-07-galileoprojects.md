[Dave Braben](http://www.frontier.co.uk/) and [Ian Bell](http://www.iancgbell.clara.net) created one of the true milestones of videogames history when they wrote Elite.  Elite was, and still is, one of the most emersive and atmospheric gaming experiences you could ever have. From the early days on the BBC through numerous incarnations on other platforms Elite's innovations have captured the hearts of gamers and although some have tried no one has yet recaptured that incredible sense of open ended freeform game design. The open source [Galileo Project](http://www.galileo-projects.org) is an attempt to do just that, only this time the developers are trying to create a fully breathing online multi-player universe..
