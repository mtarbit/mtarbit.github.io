On the eve of Gamecube's home release [Capcom](http://cube.ign.com/news/38267.html) have announced that their [Biohazard / Resident Evil](http://cube.ign.com/news/38266.html) series will be [exclusive](http://cube.ign.com/news/38268.html) to Nintendo's console from now on.
Having said that I'm not sure how exclusive an exclusive can be when the majority of the titles already exist on other consoles? This move should certainly garner some support from the die hard Biohazard heads in Japan, and add to Nintendo's argument that Gamecube is not just for kids..

On a similar subject pocket.IGN have just given [Advance Wars](http://pocket.ign.com/reviews/15424.html) for Gameboy Advance an impressive 9.9 out of 10 and an Editors Choice Award, looks like one to add to your collection..
