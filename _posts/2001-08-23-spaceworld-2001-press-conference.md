Well Spaceworld starts tomorrow and as ever Nintendo have opened the floodgates a day early with their pre-show press conference. Shigeru Miyamoto took to the stage and stunned the crowd with a first look at [Mario and Zelda](http://cube.ign.com/news/37665.html) on Gamecube. Zelda especially was a shock to the system, featuring amazingly fluid cartoon style cell shading rather than the full 3D renders shown previously at the Tokyo Gameshow. 

Nintendo also announced that Gamecube's US launch would be [delayed](http://cube.ign.com/news/37654.html) by 2 weeks till Nov 18. Critically this pushes the release back till 10 days after the launch of Microsoft's X-Box console. To compensate Nintendo announced that Gamecube would now launch in [2 colours](http://media.cloudchaser.com/nintendo/events/sw2k1/pressevent/PressConference01.jpg) (Indigo & Black) in the US with an Orange version to follow in Japan..

Nintendo also revealed fresh footage of the following titles; [1080 GC](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies/1080.mov), [Metroid Prime](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies/metroid.mov), [Soul Calibur II](http://cube.ign.com/news/37666.html), [Rune](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies/rune.mov) and [Bomberman](http://cubemovies.ign.com/media/space2k1/pressmovies/bomberman.mov). Expect a host of other announcements and details on these and other titles over the next few days. Keep checking back here and we'll point you in the direction of the best coverage..
