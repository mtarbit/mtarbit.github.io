PC heads among you may be interested in this bit of software from TGT Soft. [StyleBuilder XP](http://www.tgtsoft.com/product.html) allows you to customize and modify XP's internal styles to your own likeing. Screenshots can be viewed [here](http://www.tgtsoft.com/stylesshots.html).. Still isn't [Aqua](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) though.
For a more thorough re-styleing of XP have a look at [Ernie XQ](http://fantabulosa.com/products/erniexq/).
