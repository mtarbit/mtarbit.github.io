Google have added yet another string to their bow with the addition of a beta version [image search](http://images.google.com/). Notable more for the total randomness of it's results than it's usefulness. It's quite easy to dig up sites from the depths of the internet with this that you would never normally stumble across with a straight text search.

Also worth a mention is the addition of [Hacker](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-hacker/), [Elmer Fudd](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-elmer/) and [Pig Latin](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-piglatin/) to the [pantheon](http://www.google.com/language.html) of [alternate language](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-bork/) searches on Google.

And if you want to show Google how much you love them you'll be interested to learn that they may be [going ahead with an IPO](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1405000/1405322.stm) at some point in the not so distant future. Go on,  throw all your hard earned cash at them! Just remember to [do the research](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/06/21/google_henziger/index.html) first.
