(I haven't actually got a copy yet, but if I pretend I have my blog gives me a nice cover picture to sit alongside this, so shhh!)

After a delay of quite a few months this book is apparently just back from the printers. But on a production with this many contributors, the odd hiccup is to be expected.

As with [the previous one][hg], it's a book of short essays on the favourite board, card & hobby games of a bevvy of games designers & games industry luminaries. This time the focus is on family games, as opposed to the RPG, wargame and CCG slant of the previous volume.

And as with _Hobby Games: The 100 Best_, once the [list of essays][list] was revealed I thought it would be interesting to be able to see the games being written about. So [here's my companion piece][fg] to the book.
