[EAGB report](http://www.eagb.net/cgi-bin/news/news.pl?action=gen_read_page&amp;id=UEih5HEVBK) that [Crawfish Interactive](http://www.crawfish.co.uk/) are going to be bringing the [Bitmap Brothers](http://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/) back catalogue to a GBA near you sometime in the not so distant future. First off the production line will be [Speedball2](http://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/Speedball2.htm), so you can start drooling now.
