Martin Dodge and Rob Kitchin are co-authors of  "[The Atlas of Cyberspace](http://www.kitchin.org/atlas/index.html)". The book aims to render in two dimensions a world which arguably doesn't even exist in 3. [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,46412,00.html) have some sample images from the book, and Martin Dodge has a collection of cyberspace maps on his own site, [Cybergeography.org](http://www.cybergeography.org/).
