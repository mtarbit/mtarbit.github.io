So if Samba de Amigo wasn't making you workout enough, here's the latest fad that's sure to have you shedding pounds. [Happy Diet](http://www.happy-diet.net/) is [Twilight Express'](http://www.twilight.co.jp/) Diet Simulator. You input your height/weight and a character appears to match your dimensions. Then he makes a nice diet for you to follow and you can go jogging with him via the use of the ["Stepping Controller"](http://www.happy-diet.net/img_stp/s_ora01.jpg). Some more details can be seen [on the back of the CD sleeve](http://www.scei.co.jp/soft/jacket/l/slps03182b.jpg).
