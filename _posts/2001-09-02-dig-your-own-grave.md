You can pre-order an Xbox at [CompUSA](http://www.compusa.com/promos/xbox/default_n.asp) as long as you buy 2 first party titles, 1 third party title and 2 accessories, nearly $500 in total. How Bill & Steve expect to go up against the video games industry with the same restrictive practices they used in the desktop PC market is beyond me. I think they forgot they don't have a monopoly in this game. Does making people buy 5 first party products to the 1 third party game not totally alienate your developers too..
