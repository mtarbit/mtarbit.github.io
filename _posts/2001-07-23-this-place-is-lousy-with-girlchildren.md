Further to my post from yesterday, an additional movie trend is that of turgid comic-book adaptations. Thank the lord then that [Dan Clowes](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowesbio.html) and [Terry Zwigoff](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Zwigoff,+Terry) seem to have [managed the impossible](http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?File=ReviewsOne.inc&amp;Id=2153) and created a comic-book film for love not money.

[Ghost World](http://www.mgm.com/ghostworld/) is based on the comic-strip of the same name taken from the pages of Clowes' [Eightball](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowes.html) comic book. Clowes' work owes a debt to the great confessor [R. Crumb](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/crumb/crumb.html), whose work Zwigoff in turn payed homage to in his documentary, [Crumb](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0109508). The pairing of these two is therefore natural, so it's no surprise that Ghost World the film has been the result of collaboration rather than slavish reproduction. Both are fantastic artists in their own rights and it's heartwarming that they've managed to see their visions through to a final release where so many others have failed.

Oh, and be sure to pick up your [little Enid action doll](http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/gwmerch.html) too.
