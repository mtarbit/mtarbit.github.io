The [Long Bets](http://www.longbets.org/) Foundation turns the less-than-noble pursuit of gambling to noble ends with it's focus on [long-term forward planning](http://www.longnow.org/) for the good of mankind and our environment. It encourages the refinement of critical thought by asking those on both sides of the debates to put their money where their mouth is.

Most of those involved are [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.05/longbets.html?pg=2) luminaries or at the forefront of their fields, but there's the odd curveball with [Ted Danson](http://www.longbets.org/bet/8) even getting involved for a more short-term, whimsical bet. Though with minimum stakes of $2000 none of the bets are made lightly.
