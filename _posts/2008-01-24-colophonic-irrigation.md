In the interests of transparency, and because I've been a sucker for them ever since I first stumbled across one in the back of [an Oreilly book](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dhtmlref/index.html), I've added [a colophon](/about/) to my about page.

It's also largely due to [Mr. Willison](http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jan/23/colophon/) putting the idea in my head this morning. He even advocates stuff when he's not intending too, [the poor fellow](http://twitter.com/simonw/statuses/635693772)!
